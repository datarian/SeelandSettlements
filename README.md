# About the data

Trees used for the construction of houses have been dated using dendrochronological methods. The exact location and dated year of the trees are shown on a map of the area with the possibility to animate the time. This enables a new perspective on the data, revealing the dynamics of settlement construction around the lake in prehistoric times.
